DESCRIPTION
===========

The `L10N::DA` distribution contains the logic to provide a Danish localization of the Raku Programming Language. It installs a `danku` executable that will automatically activate the Danish localization. And it allows one to use the Danish localization in selected programs with a `use L10N::DA` statement.
